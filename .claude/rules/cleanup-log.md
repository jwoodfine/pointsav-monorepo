# Cleanup Log — pointsav-monorepo

Living record of in-flight cleanup work, open questions, and decisions made during active development. This file is read at session start and updated at session end when meaningful cleanup occurs. Maintained in-repo so the history travels with the code.

---

## How this file is maintained

- **Read at session start.** Claude Code reads this file at the start of every session (per the instruction in `CLAUDE.md`). The tables below reflect the current state of in-flight work. Apply the guidance before touching any related files.
- **Update at session end.** When a session includes meaningful cleanup — renames across multiple files, deprecated code removal, resolving an open question, surfacing a new one — append a dated entry to the top of the **Session entries** section at the bottom of this file.
- **Do not log trivial edits.** Single-file typo fixes, comment tweaks, or routine formatting changes do not belong here. This log is a record of decisions, not of every keystroke.
- **Commit each update with the code changes it describes.** The log and the work it documents travel together through git history.

## Interpreting build signals during cleanup

Until the workspace `Cargo.toml` is unified (see Layer 1 audit findings), `cargo build --workspace` and `cargo check` at the repo root only exercise the 8 declared members. The other ~70 crates are not covered by workspace-level commands. When making changes to any crate outside the declared members, run `cargo check` inside that crate's directory specifically. Do not rely on workspace-root build signals to confirm correctness across the full repo. This caveat lifts when the workspace is unified.

## Active legacy-to-canonical renames

These substitutions are known and in progress. Canonical names are from the Nomenclature Matrix. When the last occurrence of a legacy name is removed from the repo, move the row to the **Completed migrations** section with the date of completion.

| Legacy | Canonical | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `service-parser` | `service-extraction` | In flight — both names present | Working name still used in portions of the active codebase. Canonical name is the long-term target. Consolidation planned for a future release. |
| `service-llm` | `service-slm` | Documentation-only inconsistency | Code references are correct. Legacy appearances in docs should be read as `service-slm`. |
| `cluster-totebox-real-property` | `cluster-totebox-property` | In flight | Appears in older deployment manifests and doc references. |
| `os-interface`, `os-integration` | `os-orchestration` | In flight | Legacy names predate the current three-layer stack nomenclature. |
| `RealPropertyArchive` | `PropertyArchive` | In flight | Appears in older archive-type documentation and possibly in legacy code comments. |

---

## Deprecations — flag and remove

Names no longer in use. Any occurrence in the repo should be flagged and removed. If a removal blocks something active, surface it — do not leave the legacy name in place silently.

| Name | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fleet-command-authority` | Deprecated — remove | Node no longer in use. Should not appear in any current deployment manifest, build script, or documentation. |

---

## Intentional exceptions — do not migrate

Items that may look like candidates for cleanup but are intentionally preserved as-is. Do not "fix" these without confirmation.

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `cluster-totebox-personnel-1` and other numbered personnel instances | Exist locally but intentionally absent from GitHub and the MEMO. Not a naming error. Do not flag as legacy. |
| Two ConsoleOS operating patterns (multi-service `node-console-operator` and single-service nodes) | Both patterns are valid. The MEMO documents `node-console-operator` only, by design, to keep official documentation clean. Do not flag the single-service pattern as an inconsistency. |

---

## Open questions

Pending confirmations that affect how Claude should describe or reason about parts of the system. Do not invent values for these. If a task requires an answer, stop and surface the question.

| Question | Current handling |
|---|---|
| Verification Surveyor daily throttle number | Under operational review. Do not cite a specific number. Refer to it as "a system-enforced daily limit" until confirmed in a future MEMO version. **Code reference (2026-04-23):** `app-console-content/scripts/surveyor.py` hard-codes `MAX_DAILY_VERIFICATIONS = 10`; whether this value is authoritative or drift is the pending decision. |
| User Guide language on Sovereign Data Foundation | The User Guide contains language treating the Foundation as a current equity holder and active auditor. Requires a language review pass before any User Guide content is reused in public-facing materials. Flag any passage that describes the Foundation as current or active. |
| `service-search` inclusion in the next MEMO | Confirmed for inclusion in the next MEMO version. Treat as canonical in code; note the doc catch-up is pending. |
| Is the per-crate independent workspace pattern intentional (some crates meant to be extractable and published separately) or accidental drift? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |
| Are `app-console-*` and `app-network-*` directories without `Cargo.toml` intentional scaffolding for planned work, or abandoned attempts? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |
| Should the doubly-nested `service-email-egress-{ews,imap}` structure be flattened, or does the nesting reflect a real protocol-implementation hierarchy? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |
| What is `discovery-queue` — runtime data that should be gitignored, reference data that belongs elsewhere, or a misplaced crate? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |
| Does `vendors-maxmind` (containing a GeoLite2 database, not code) belong as a `vendor-*` crate at all, or should it move to a non-workspace data directory? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |

## Completed migrations

Migrations fully resolved in the repo. Moved here from **Active legacy-to-canonical renames** when the last occurrence of the legacy name is removed. Empty for now.

*(none yet — move rows here as migrations close out)*

## Session entries

Newest on top. Append a dated block when a session includes meaningful cleanup work. Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD
- What changed (files touched, counts, rationale)
- What was left pending and why
- New open questions surfaced
```

## 2026-04-23

- **Repo-layout rule introduced.** Added
  `.claude/rules/repo-layout.md` codifying the allowed file set at
  the monorepo root and at each project directory root, and naming
  the sibling repos where cross-cutting content belongs (user guides,
  ADRs, design-system material). Anchor for the file-relocation work
  queued behind it (see `NEXT.md`).
- **Defects surfaced at root by this rule** — staged for separate
  commits, not moved in this session:
  - ~~`force_build.sh` (tracked, at repo root) → queued move to
    `vendor-sel4-kernel/scripts/`~~ **Closed 2026-04-23** — moved
    via `git mv` in a follow-up commit within this session. Zero
    runtime callers; script body uses absolute paths so no content
    edits required.
  - `GUIDE-OPERATIONS.md` (tracked, at repo root) → queued move to
    `content-wiki-documentation/`.
  - `USER_GUIDE_2026-03-30_V2.md` (tracked, at repo root) → queued
    move to `content-wiki-documentation/` with `_V2` dropped, per
    CLAUDE.md §6 edit-in-place rule.
  - ~~`app-console-content/src/{pointsav-surveyor.sh,surveyor.py}` →
    queued move to `app-console-content/scripts/`~~ **Closed
    2026-04-23** — both files moved via `git mv` (recognised as
    100% renames). Shell wrapper uses `$(dirname "$0")/surveyor.py`
    (relative) so the pair moves together without edits. Python
    script uses absolute paths into `woodfine-fleet-deployment` so
    location-independent. Zero intra-repo runtime callers; no cron
    entries found. The clone at `~/Foundry/clones/service-slm/`
    retains its copy on branch `cluster/service-slm` (separate
    `.git/`) and is unaffected by this move on `main`; it will
    receive the change only when that branch merges.
  - ~~`os-infrastructure/build_iso/forge_iso.sh` → queued rename to
    `os-infrastructure/build_iso/compile_binary.sh`~~ **Closed
    2026-04-23** — renamed via `git mv`; in-file header comment
    updated to reflect the new name and record the rename
    rationale. Zero external callers.
- **Project-root scripts flagged (not yet moved):** ~15 scripts sit
  at project root instead of under `scripts/` across `service-vpn`
  (5 generator scripts), `service-email` (`spool-daemon.sh`),
  `service-slm` (`cognitive-bridge.sh`), `service-content`
  (`forge-seeds.sh`), `os-network-admin` (2 scripts),
  `os-totebox` (1), `tool-cognitive-forge` (1),
  `vendor-phi3-mini` (2), `app-mediakit-telemetry` (5 generic
  scaffold scripts). Each project is a separate closure task.
- **Open question surfaced.** `surveyor.py` hard-codes
  `MAX_DAILY_VERIFICATIONS = 10`. The existing cleanup-log open
  question — "Verification Surveyor daily throttle number — Under
  operational review. Do not cite a specific number" — must
  reconcile: either the code is authoritative (close the question,
  value is 10) or the doc is authoritative (the code is out of step
  and needs updating). Do not cite the number externally until
  resolved.
- **Second open question surfaced (os-infrastructure build
  pipeline).** The two scripts `os-infrastructure/forge_iso.sh`
  (ISO assembly) and `os-infrastructure/build_iso/compile_binary.sh`
  (binary compile, renamed this session) are sequential build
  stages but are not wired together — the assembly script does not
  invoke the compile script, and there is no Makefile or top-level
  driver. Operator must run them manually in order. Is this
  intentional (operator-gated two-step) or drift (should become a
  single driver script)? Pending decision before next pipeline
  refactor.

## 2026-04-22

- **Project framework bootstrap.** Added `.claude/rules/project-registry.md`
  with 100-row inventory of every top-level directory, classified by
  state per `~/Foundry/CLAUDE.md` §8 (Reserved-folder /
  Scaffold-coded / Active / Defect / Not-a-project). Framework docs,
  templates, and activation procedure live workspace-level. This
  cleanup-log was also introduced onto `main` today (previously
  present only on feature branches — drift closed).
- **Taxonomy expanded to seven domains.** Added `app-orchestration-*`
  to the in-force `app-[os]-*` list in
  `~/Foundry/IT_SUPPORT_Nomenclature_Matrix_V8.md` §3. Triggered by
  `app-orchestration-bim` appearing during the session — would have
  been an unmatched-prefix defect under the original six-domain
  rule. Now conformant; `os-orchestration` already exists as a
  Systemic Wordmark (§2).
- **Four BIM-research directories registered.** `app-console-bim`,
  `app-orchestration-bim`, `app-workplace-bim`, `service-bim` — each
  with a single `RESEARCH.md`. Classified as Reserved-folder pending
  decision to activate.
- **Audit cleanup.** Removed 2 `__MACOSX/` directories and 16
  tracked `.DS_Store` / AppleDouble files from extraction-artefact
  scaffolding in the egress crates. Added `.DS_Store` to
  `.gitignore`.

## 2026-04-18 — Layer 1 structural audit — findings

- **Headline finding:** Workspace `Cargo.toml` declares only 8 of ~70+ crates as members. Everything else is treated as standalone workspaces, which explains the 23 stray `Cargo.lock` files scattered through the repo. `cargo build --workspace` will skip almost everything; profile/edition inheritance is not reaching most crates.
- **Severity counts:** 1 Critical, 1 High, 4 Medium, 1 Low.
  - Critical: workspace under-declaration (8 of ~70+ crates).
  - High: 23 stray `Cargo.lock` files inside member crates.
  - Medium: prefix violations (2); dir-name vs `Cargo.toml` name mismatches (13); doubly-nested `service-email-egress-{ews,imap}` scaffolding; many `app-console-*` / `app-network-*` directories without `Cargo.toml`.
  - Low: `discovery-queue` orphan data directory at root.
- **Good news on prefix adherence:** across ~85 directories, adherence to the seven canonical prefixes is approximately 97.6%. Only two violations found: `pointsav-pty-bridge` (no recognized prefix) and `vendors-maxmind` (plural form instead of canonical `vendor-`).
- **Nested redundancy:** `service-email-egress-ews` and `service-email-egress-imap` both contain a redundant intermediate directory of the same name — a doubly-nested copy-paste scaffolding pattern producing depth-3 crates. All 13 directory-name / `Cargo.toml`-name mismatches are concentrated in these nested egress areas (short dir names like `egress-ingress` aliasing qualified crate names like `service-email-batch-ingress`).
- **No modifications were made in this session — audit only.**
- **Next:** Open Questions section of this log to be updated separately with five new questions raised by the audit.

## 2026-04-18

- Initialized this cleanup log. Seeded active renames, deprecations, intentional exceptions, and open questions from Section 13 of the PointSav Project Instructions.
- Established the session-start / session-end read-and-update pattern in CLAUDE.md.
- No code changes in this session. Next session should confirm the active renames table against a fresh grep of the repo to establish a baseline count of remaining occurrences per legacy term.
- Open question surfaced: whether the `service-parser` / `service-extraction` consolidation is scoped for a specific MEMO version or tracked informally. Answer will determine how we prioritize closing that migration.
