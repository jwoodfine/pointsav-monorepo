# Cleanup Log — pointsav-monorepo

Living record of in-flight cleanup work, open questions, and decisions made during active development. This file is read at session start and updated at session end when meaningful cleanup occurs. Maintained in-repo so the history travels with the code.

---

## How this file is maintained

- **Read at session start.** Claude Code reads this file at the start of every session (per the instruction in `CLAUDE.md`). The tables below reflect the current state of in-flight work. Apply the guidance before touching any related files.
- **Update at session end.** When a session includes meaningful cleanup — renames across multiple files, deprecated code removal, resolving an open question, surfacing a new one — append a dated entry to the top of the **Session entries** section at the bottom of this file.
- **Do not log trivial edits.** Single-file typo fixes, comment tweaks, or routine formatting changes do not belong here. This log is a record of decisions, not of every keystroke.
- **Commit each update with the code changes it describes.** The log and the work it documents travel together through git history.

## Interpreting build signals during cleanup

Until the workspace `Cargo.toml` is unified (see Layer 1 audit findings), `cargo build --workspace` and `cargo check` at the repo root only exercise the 8 declared members. The other ~70 crates are not covered by workspace-level commands. When making changes to any crate outside the declared members, run `cargo check` inside that crate's directory specifically. Do not rely on workspace-root build signals to confirm correctness across the full repo. This caveat lifts when the workspace is unified.

## Active legacy-to-canonical renames

These substitutions are known and in progress. Canonical names are from the Nomenclature Matrix. When the last occurrence of a legacy name is removed from the repo, move the row to the **Completed migrations** section with the date of completion.

| Legacy | Canonical | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `service-parser` | `service-extraction` | In flight — both names present | Working name still used in portions of the active codebase. Canonical name is the long-term target. Consolidation planned for a future release. |
| `service-llm` | `service-slm` | Documentation-only inconsistency | Code references are correct. Legacy appearances in docs should be read as `service-slm`. |
| `cluster-totebox-real-property` | `cluster-totebox-property` | In flight | Appears in older deployment manifests and doc references. |
| `os-interface`, `os-integration` | `os-orchestration` | In flight | Legacy names predate the current three-layer stack nomenclature. |
| `RealPropertyArchive` | `PropertyArchive` | In flight | Appears in older archive-type documentation and possibly in legacy code comments. |

---

## Deprecations — flag and remove

Names no longer in use. Any occurrence in the repo should be flagged and removed. If a removal blocks something active, surface it — do not leave the legacy name in place silently.

| Name | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fleet-command-authority` | Deprecated — remove | Node no longer in use. Should not appear in any current deployment manifest, build script, or documentation. |

---

## Intentional exceptions — do not migrate

Items that may look like candidates for cleanup but are intentionally preserved as-is. Do not "fix" these without confirmation.

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `cluster-totebox-personnel-1` and other numbered personnel instances | Exist locally but intentionally absent from GitHub and the MEMO. Not a naming error. Do not flag as legacy. |
| Two ConsoleOS operating patterns (multi-service `node-console-operator` and single-service nodes) | Both patterns are valid. The MEMO documents `node-console-operator` only, by design, to keep official documentation clean. Do not flag the single-service pattern as an inconsistency. |

---

## Open questions

Pending confirmations that affect how Claude should describe or reason about parts of the system. Do not invent values for these. If a task requires an answer, stop and surface the question.

| Question | Current handling |
|---|---|
| Verification Surveyor daily throttle number | Under operational review. Do not cite a specific number. Refer to it as "a system-enforced daily limit" until confirmed in a future MEMO version. |
| User Guide language on Sovereign Data Foundation | The User Guide contains language treating the Foundation as a current equity holder and active auditor. Requires a language review pass before any User Guide content is reused in public-facing materials. Flag any passage that describes the Foundation as current or active. |
| `service-search` inclusion in the next MEMO | Confirmed for inclusion in the next MEMO version. Treat as canonical in code; note the doc catch-up is pending. |
| Is the per-crate independent workspace pattern intentional (some crates meant to be extractable and published separately) or accidental drift? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |
| Are `app-console-*` and `app-network-*` directories without `Cargo.toml` intentional scaffolding for planned work, or abandoned attempts? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |
| Should the doubly-nested `service-email-egress-{ews,imap}` structure be flattened, or does the nesting reflect a real protocol-implementation hierarchy? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |
| What is `discovery-queue` — runtime data that should be gitignored, reference data that belongs elsewhere, or a misplaced crate? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |
| Does `vendors-maxmind` (containing a GeoLite2 database, not code) belong as a `vendor-*` crate at all, or should it move to a non-workspace data directory? | Pending decision — do not act on related findings until answered. |

## Completed migrations

Migrations fully resolved in the repo. Moved here from **Active legacy-to-canonical renames** when the last occurrence of the legacy name is removed. Empty for now.

*(none yet — move rows here as migrations close out)*

## Session entries

Newest on top. Append a dated block when a session includes meaningful cleanup work. Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD
- What changed (files touched, counts, rationale)
- What was left pending and why
- New open questions surfaced
```

## 2026-04-22

- **Project framework bootstrap.** Added `.claude/rules/project-registry.md`
  with 100-row inventory of every top-level directory, classified by
  state per `~/Foundry/CLAUDE.md` §8 (Reserved-folder /
  Scaffold-coded / Active / Defect / Not-a-project). Framework docs,
  templates, and activation procedure live workspace-level. This
  cleanup-log was also introduced onto `main` today (previously
  present only on feature branches — drift closed).
- **Taxonomy expanded to seven domains.** Added `app-orchestration-*`
  to the in-force `app-[os]-*` list in
  `~/Foundry/IT_SUPPORT_Nomenclature_Matrix_V8.md` §3. Triggered by
  `app-orchestration-bim` appearing during the session — would have
  been an unmatched-prefix defect under the original six-domain
  rule. Now conformant; `os-orchestration` already exists as a
  Systemic Wordmark (§2).
- **Four BIM-research directories registered.** `app-console-bim`,
  `app-orchestration-bim`, `app-workplace-bim`, `service-bim` — each
  with a single `RESEARCH.md`. Classified as Reserved-folder pending
  decision to activate.
- **Audit cleanup.** Removed 2 `__MACOSX/` directories and 16
  tracked `.DS_Store` / AppleDouble files from extraction-artefact
  scaffolding in the egress crates. Added `.DS_Store` to
  `.gitignore`.

## 2026-04-18 — Layer 1 structural audit — findings

- **Headline finding:** Workspace `Cargo.toml` declares only 8 of ~70+ crates as members. Everything else is treated as standalone workspaces, which explains the 23 stray `Cargo.lock` files scattered through the repo. `cargo build --workspace` will skip almost everything; profile/edition inheritance is not reaching most crates.
- **Severity counts:** 1 Critical, 1 High, 4 Medium, 1 Low.
  - Critical: workspace under-declaration (8 of ~70+ crates).
  - High: 23 stray `Cargo.lock` files inside member crates.
  - Medium: prefix violations (2); dir-name vs `Cargo.toml` name mismatches (13); doubly-nested `service-email-egress-{ews,imap}` scaffolding; many `app-console-*` / `app-network-*` directories without `Cargo.toml`.
  - Low: `discovery-queue` orphan data directory at root.
- **Good news on prefix adherence:** across ~85 directories, adherence to the seven canonical prefixes is approximately 97.6%. Only two violations found: `pointsav-pty-bridge` (no recognized prefix) and `vendors-maxmind` (plural form instead of canonical `vendor-`).
- **Nested redundancy:** `service-email-egress-ews` and `service-email-egress-imap` both contain a redundant intermediate directory of the same name — a doubly-nested copy-paste scaffolding pattern producing depth-3 crates. All 13 directory-name / `Cargo.toml`-name mismatches are concentrated in these nested egress areas (short dir names like `egress-ingress` aliasing qualified crate names like `service-email-batch-ingress`).
- **No modifications were made in this session — audit only.**
- **Next:** Open Questions section of this log to be updated separately with five new questions raised by the audit.

## 2026-04-18

- Initialized this cleanup log. Seeded active renames, deprecations, intentional exceptions, and open questions from Section 13 of the PointSav Project Instructions.
- Established the session-start / session-end read-and-update pattern in CLAUDE.md.
- No code changes in this session. Next session should confirm the active renames table against a fresh grep of the repo to establish a baseline count of remaining occurrences per legacy term.
- Open question surfaced: whether the `service-parser` / `service-extraction` consolidation is scoped for a specific MEMO version or tracked informally. Answer will determine how we prioritize closing that migration.
