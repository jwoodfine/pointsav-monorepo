## os-totebox PPN build-out (active — session 1 complete 2026-06-11)

- [x] service-people HTTP API v0.1 — GET /v1/people + GET /v1/people/{id}, port :9091 (997b8d22) [2026-06-11]
- [x] service-extraction workspace unification — added to root Cargo.toml members (997b8d22) [2026-06-11]

## JOURNAL programme — active blockers

- [x] **J7 HOLD lifted** — Abstract, Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Hypotheses, Falsification
      Programme written (~2,600 words); committed 8ab01ff2. §4-§8 stubs pending implementation evidence. [2026-06-11]
- [ ] **J7 language pass** — forbidden_terms_cleared: false; language pass required before submission.
- [ ] **J1 §7.2 OLS regression** — `log(catchment_entropy) ~ tier + log(pop_150km) + C(country)`.
      Blocked on Phase 24B: Kontur H3 population join to `work/clusters-ols.csv`. [2026-05-28]
- [ ] **J1 permutation test** — `sim-tier-permutation.py`; 10,000 spatial shuffles, one-tailed p-value. [2026-05-28]
- [ ] **J3 §6 Results** — AEC flood + seismic build coverage metrics required. [2026-05-29]
      AEC build results checked 2026-06-01:
      - **Seismic (cron 2026-06-01T05:00Z): partial — EXIT 0, but 3 layers skipped:**
        USGS NSHM CONUS (curl empty reply from ScienceBase), ESHM20 EU (GeoJSON not produced),
        GWL_FCS30 wetland (download failed). EU + wetland skip → coverage incomplete for J3.
        Ran twice (05:00Z + 05:12Z); second run also stuck at [1/9]. Needs fix in project-gis.
      - **Flood (cron 2026-06-01T05:18Z): FAILED at step [15/17]** — Python `$META_PATH`
        env var not expanded (`Path('$META_PATH').read_text()` literal, not `os.environ`).
        Needs fix in project-gis `build-aec-flood.sh`. Outbox flagged to Command.
      Coverage metrics still blocked. Will unblock after fixes + re-runs.
- [ ] **J3 coverage metrics export** — write `export-aec-coverage.py` additions after both builds complete and produce valid data.
- [ ] **J4 §4–§5 language pass** — at project-editorial (outbox ref: 952b2b09). [2026-05-29]

## Mailbox contamination — ongoing issue

Inbox, outbox, and NEXT.md have been overwritten by Stage 6 rebase operations three times
since 2026-06-05. Each time content from other archives (project-console, project-knowledge,
project-gis, project-intelligence) overwrites this archive's files. Command Session should
investigate the Stage 6/sync-local.sh path that is causing this.
