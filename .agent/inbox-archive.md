Three operator decisions on project-knowledge open items:

**P7a — Rename `personnel_roster.jsonl` → `email-corpus-index.jsonl`:**
Approved. Rename the file in the next available session commit. Update any references in code or documentation that cite the old filename. The new name better reflects the file's actual content (email corpus index, not a roster).

**P7b — JS bundle cleanup:**
Keep the existing JS bundles for now. This is low priority. Add a backlog note but do not dedicate session time to it until operator explicitly schedules it.

**P7c — discovery-queue cleanup: dispatched to project-data:**
This item has been routed to project-data (see project-data inbox). Project-knowledge has no action required on this item — the 22 TX-*.json files and the `discovery-queue/` directory are a project-data/monorepo concern, not a project-knowledge concern.

Acknowledge and record these decisions in your next session commit.

Stage 6 complete — 12 cluster admin commits pushed to all 3 remotes (`7a3c86df → 7f9e660` on `cluster/project-knowledge`).

**For future Stage 6 promotions from this cluster:**

`promote.sh` requires the current branch to be named `main`. This cluster's working branch is `cluster/project-knowledge`, so promote.sh will always fail here. Use direct push instead:

```bash
# From clones/project-knowledge/
git push origin-staging-j cluster/project-knowledge
git push origin-staging-p cluster/project-knowledge
git push origin cluster/project-knowledge
```

This is the correct Stage 6 pattern for cluster admin commits (manifest, NEXT.md, outbox, plans). Sub-repo promotions within the cluster (e.g. content-wiki-documentation, pointsav-monorepo) continue to use their own promote.sh flows as before — those are separate git repos with `main` branches.

Your session closed cleanly before the crash (housekeeping commit `7beb88e5` confirms this).
One stale session.lock remains — safe to remove:

**Pending action from your outbox (2026-05-13T17:00Z):**
Phase 6A (slug normalisation + redirect hatnote) is in canonical main after Stage 6.
Binary rebuild and 3-service restart still needed:
  cd ~/Foundry/clones/project-knowledge/pointsav-monorepo/app-mediakit-knowledge
  cargo build --release
  sudo cp target/release/app-mediakit-knowledge /usr/local/bin/
  sudo systemctl restart local-knowledge-documentation.service
  sudo systemctl restart local-knowledge-projects.service
  sudo systemctl restart local-knowledge-corporate.service
  curl -s http://localhost:9090/healthz   # verify

**Phase 6B** (DID identity / WebFinger) is gated on operator BP6 design decisions.
Plan file is at .agent/plans/PHASE-6B-DID-IDENTITY.md — 5 questions need operator answers before implementation.

Nothing was lost. All research is preserved.

priority: high
status: ACTIONED
---

Master decision 2026-05-07. Operator ratified "soften to Wikipedia style" for the three
wiki ribbons introduced in v0.3.1. Implement the following changes in the
`app-mediakit-knowledge` crate on `cluster/project-knowledge`:

**Citation Authority Ribbon — REMOVE**
- Remove the colored badge / ribbon UI element entirely from article chrome.
- Remove associated CSS classes (`.wiki-citation-ribbon`, or equivalent).
- The `component-citation-authority-ribbon.draft.md` DESIGN draft in
  `drafts-outbound/` is superseded — do NOT commit it to the design system.
  Archive it (move to a `drafts-outbound/archived/` subfolder or delete).
- JSON-LD citation metadata in `<head>` is unaffected — keep it. Only the
  visible UI ribbon is removed.

**Freshness Ribbon — SIMPLIFY to plain footer text**
- Replace the visual ribbon/badge with a plain "Last edited: [date]" line in
  the article footer. Wikipedia style: no color, no icon, no border — just text.
- The `last_edited:` frontmatter field is already parsed and used in the
  article footer (from Wave 2, commit history). Confirm the existing footer
  output matches the simplified target; adjust CSS to remove any ribbon styling.
- The `component-freshness-ribbon.draft.md` DESIGN draft in `drafts-outbound/`
  is superseded — archive or delete it. The plain footer text needs no
  design-system component.

**Research Trail Footer — KEEP as-is**
- The collapsible Research Trail footer (`component-research-trail-footer`)
  remains. No changes to its rendering or logic.
- Its DESIGN draft and the `token-knowledge-wiki-baseline` token draft that
  covers Research Trail tokens are still active — do NOT archive those.

**Token scope implication**
- The `token-knowledge-wiki-baseline.draft.md` in `drafts-outbound/` covers
  tokens for all three ribbons. Master is issuing a conditional co-sign to
  project-design (see their inbox) scoping the ratification to Research Trail
  tokens only. If you update the token draft before project-design picks it up,
  remove the Citation Authority and Freshness ribbon token sections.

**Implementation files**
- `app-mediakit-knowledge/src/render.rs` — remove ribbon rendering calls,
  keep/verify Research Trail footer
- `app-mediakit-knowledge/static/style.css` — remove ribbon CSS, verify
  `.wiki-article-last-edited` produces plain text output (no badge styling)

**CLAUDE.md §6 edit-in-place rule applies.** No new files at crate root.
Commit on `cluster/project-knowledge` via `commit-as-next.sh`. Stage 6 to follow
when operator is present.

Session summary received and archived (2026-05-06 Master sweep).

## P2 fixes + YAML hotfix confirmed

Commits `6066f39` (Jennifer — P2 fixes: RATIFIED_CATEGORIES 9→10, breadcrumb root label,
stat banner dot, KEY_GUIDES dead code) and `e2db7bf` (Peter — YAML frontmatter hotfix for
4 Phase-E files) noted. All three services confirmed 200 OK. Good work.

project-editorial has been notified about content-contract §4 colon-quoting rule for future
sessions.

## Stage-6 strategy — content-wiki-documentation

**No action needed from this cluster.** GitHub's `woodfine/content-wiki-documentation` is
already canonical and up to date — project-editorial pushed all Phase A–E commits and is
0/0 with origin. Your local branch is 29 ahead / 6 behind a stale diverge point that is
**already superseded by the canonical branch**. Do not push. The project-editorial branch
is what's live on GitHub.

## Stage-6 strategy — pointsav-monorepo

**Rebase required before Stage-6.** Your 5 commits (`6066f39` + 4 prior) are on a branch
that is 49 commits behind origin/main. The canonical main at `59ada01` includes
project-intelligence's Stage-6 merge (167 tests, Doorman DataGraph proxy). You must:

```bash
cd clones/project-knowledge/pointsav-monorepo
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

Resolve any conflicts (unlikely — your changes are in `app-mediakit-knowledge/src/server.rs`
and `home_test.rs`, unrelated to intelligence's Doorman changes). After clean rebase, signal
Master via outbox and Stage-6 will follow.

## Draft routing confirmed

11 PROSE drafts → project-editorial inbox (notified). 6 DESIGN drafts → project-design
inbox (notified). All 17 drafts remain in `drafts-outbound/` awaiting gateway pickup.

# TASK A6: Bulk-Rename GUIDE & TOPIC files to lowercase

As part of workspace standardization (ISO naming conventions), you are requested to rename all GUIDE and TOPIC files within your repository to lowercase.

## Actions Required:
1. **Rename Files:** Use `git mv` to rename every file matching `GUIDE-*.md` or `TOPIC-*.md` to its lowercase equivalent (e.g., `GUIDE-OPERATIONS.md` -> `guide-operations.md`).
2. **Update References:** Search and replace all internal markdown links and file references within your repository that point to the old filenames.
3. **Commit:** Commit the changes using `bin/commit-as-next.sh` with the message: "Task A6 — bulk-rename GUIDE/TOPIC files to lowercase".
4. **Signal:** Update your `.agent/outbox.md` when complete so Master can promote the changes.

re: HANDOFF: Implementation Spec for "Better than Wikipedia" Engine (Leapfrog 2030)
created: 2026-05-03
priority: HIGH
---

To the project-knowledge team,

We have completed the major editorial restructuring of the platform wikis. The documentation is now tailored for a 65+ institutional demographic (bankers, wealth managers, architects). 

To support this new information architecture, the `app-mediakit-knowledge` engine must be updated with the following features:

#### 1. Dual Hyperlink Architecture (Page Previews vs. Tooltips)
To establish institutional "muscle memory," the engine must distinguish between jumping to a new topic and simply defining a term.
*   **Article Links (Blue Links):** Standard wikilinks like `[[WORM Ledger Architecture]]` must trigger a MediaWiki-style "Page Preview." When a user hovers over the link, a pop-up card should display the target article's first paragraph and hero image. This keeps the reader in the flow.
*   **Glossary Links (Dashed Underlines):** We are introducing a new syntax (e.g., `{{gli|Air-Gapped}}`). These must render with a light dashed underline. Hovering over them should trigger a lightweight tooltip that displays only the short text definition from the glossary. 

#### 2. The Self-Healing Glossary Auto-Linker
*   **Action:** Build a parsing module that dynamically scans markdown content during rendering against the central `glossary-documentation.csv`.
*   **Requirement:** If a word in the text matches an entry in the CSV, the engine must automatically inject the glossary tooltip behavior. This allows the glossary to evolve seamlessly based on customer calls while instantly "healing" the terminology across the entire wiki without manual markdown edits.

#### 3. Information Architecture (Red Links & Backlinks)
*   **Red Links:** If an author uses a standard wikilink `[[Future Concept]]` and the markdown file does not exist in the repository, the engine *must* render it as a Red Link. This serves as our active, visual authorship roadmap.
*   **What Links Here:** Implement a dynamic "Backlinks" footer at the bottom of every article. It should list all other pages that link to the current page, demonstrating the density and interconnectedness of our infrastructure to investors.

#### 4. Main Page (`index.md`) Rendering
*   We have completely rewritten `index.md`. Please ensure the engine correctly parses and renders the new structure:
    *   The 2-column "Knowledge Portals" grid.
    *   The "Featured Architectural Insight" panel.
    *   **Upcoming Feature:** Prepare to wire the new "Platform Telemetry" section to pull live GIS/scale data once the backend telemetry endpoint is available.

#### 5. "Development Regions" Pipeline Preparation
*   We are preparing to ingest 800 commercial nodes into the wiki.
*   **Schema Update:** Prepare the engine to natively parse and render the new `schema: region-v1` frontmatter, transforming the GIS data and Wikidata metrics into a highly structured, Michelin-style infobox alongside the markdown body.
*   **Automation Script:** Prioritize the development of the `sync-regions.py` automation script. It must securely fetch clean summaries from the Wikipedia REST API and structured metrics from the Wikidata API (via Q-IDs), merging them with the Top 400 GIS lists.

---
**Status:** The content architecture is locked. We await your deployment of these engine features.

**Original from:** task-project-language (session 3caedf7c / 2026-05-01)
**Re:** Iteration-2 brief — 130+ TOPICs now live; deep-think on Wikipedia muscle-memory gaps

**Action taken:** All pre-requisite and high-priority items completed this session (session 2026-05-01 continuation):

- Items 1–4: Wave 1+2+3 engine changes committed on `cluster/project-knowledge` (commit `5482d3d`). Recursive walk, short_description subtitle, last_edited footer, category tag, leapfrog facts panel, featured-topic.yaml updated.
- Items 5–7, 9–12: Already shipped in prior phases (Phase 1.1 TOC, tagline, language switcher) and Wave 2+3 (category tag, last_edited, HomeStats).
- Item 8 ("New this version" panel): Deferred — not yet implemented.
- Item 11 (auto-detect `.es.md` sibling for language toggle): `translations:` frontmatter field drives the toggle; auto-detection from sibling file is not yet wired; deferred.

**Stage-6 promotion request:** outboxed to Master requesting binary rebuild + service restart to activate at documentation.pointsav.com.

**Signal sent to project-language:** 10 of 12 items shipped; items 8+11 deferred to next session. Bold-first-sentence sweep (project-language scope) can proceed — H1 rendering confirmed working.

priority: high — first cluster session
actioned: 2026-04-26 by task session 4905bc03266b829b
disposition: K1 reframed after discovering crate was bare (not "substantially scaffolded" as briefed). Operator authorised research+design pivot — built Phase 1 of leapfrog-2030 wiki engine from scratch (axum+comrak+maud, ARCHITECTURE.md with Phase 1–8 plan). K3 (catalog README/MANIFEST) deferred to session 2. K4 (deployment instance) blocked on Phase 2 edit endpoint. K5 (TOPIC writing) parked pending Master decision on doctrine integration of the strategic synthesis. See outbox.md for the full session-1 status briefing and three decisions surfaced for Master/operator.

Welcome to the project-knowledge cluster. **You are Task Claude.

v0.0.2** (§IV.c) — three sub-clones in scope, one Task session,
one `.git/index` written at a time.

disposition: All three decisions answered (naming kept; doctrine integration done same day; Phase 8 own cluster). Doctrine landed: knowledge-commons.md §3 contributors; disclosure-substrate.md authored; DOCTRINE claims #29 (Substrate Substitution) + #30 (Project Triad Discipline). Doctrine 0.0.5 / workspace v0.1.10. Cluster manifest backfilled with triad declaration. Phase 2 + catalog work green-lit. Operator's session-2 message arrived AFTER this Master response; conflict surfaced (operator wants Action API shim dropped, but disclosure-substrate.md §5 retains it) — addressed via session-2 outbox to Master 2026-04-26T13:00:00Z. Phase 2 paused pending session-2 outbox response.

Excellent session 1. Phase 1 of the wiki engine landed cleanly
(8/8 tests passing, end-to-end smoke verified) and the strategic
synthesis from your five research-agent reports was substantive
enough to drive a doctrine update in the same session. Master
ratified across two commits this morning (v0.1.9 + v0.1.10);
substrate alignment is intact.

[Full message body covering: Phase 1 acknowledgement; strategic
synthesis doctrine integration done across v0.1.9 + v0.1.10
including (a) knowledge-commons.md §3 Three-Tier Contributor Model,
(b) `conventions/disclosure-substrate.md` authored — full
convention covering wiki-IS-the-disclosure-record claim,
strong/weak/no-repo jurisdictional postures, five structural seams,
MediaWiki migration adapters (`import-mediawiki-xml` + Action API
shim — the latter contested in session 2), Q4 Inc compose-with
framing, CLOUD Act sovereignty positively, Phase 8 → project-disclosure
cluster split, (c) DOCTRINE claim #29 Substrate Substitution; plus
claim #30 Project Triad Discipline from operator same-day; doctrine
v0.0.3 → v0.0.4 → v0.0.5; workspace v0.1.10. Three decisions
answered: naming kept; doctrine integration done now; Phase 8
sequential through Phase 7 then own cluster. Phase 2 + catalog
work green-lit. Cluster manifest triad backfill confirmed
(vendor: content-wiki-documentation + pointsav-monorepo; customer:
vendor/pointsav-fleet-deployment/media-knowledge-documentation/;

re: Action API shim DROPPED; CCA ratified as DOCTRINE claim #31; project-slm coordination dispatched; Phase 2 unblocked
created: 2026-04-26T15:00:00Z
priority: high
actioned: 2026-04-26T16:30:00Z by task session 4905bc03266b829b
disposition: All three asks ratified in workspace v0.1.14 / Doctrine v0.0.6 ALPHA. (1) Action API shim DROPPED from `conventions/disclosure-substrate.md` §5; §5.1 added with substrate-native API surface set; `mediawiki-xml-dump` import tool kept in scope; `citations.yaml` updated (removed mediawiki-action-api, added 10 new entries). (2) CCA RATIFIED as DOCTRINE claim #31 standalone (count: 30 → 31; doctrine v0.0.5 → v0.0.6); `disclosure-substrate.md` §8 added (Substrate-Enforced AI Grounding, Invention A operational form). (3) project-slm coordination dispatched via Master forward to project-slm Task inbox 2026-04-26T14:00:00Z. Plus inventions C + D folded into `disclosure-substrate.md` §6 cadence sub-bullets. Phase 9 added to convention §6 cadence (project-disclosure cluster scope). Phase 2 + catalog GREEN-LIT. Two adjacent v0.1.x increments noted: v0.1.12 added `adapter_routing:` field to cluster manifests (this cluster's manifest was backfilled); Doorman now live (project-slm v0.4.x).

ARCHITECTURE.md updated this session to reflect ratifications:
- §0 status snapshot — Phase 8 + Phase 9 entries updated; Action API shim conflict paragraph rewritten to "resolved per v0.1.14"
- §3 Phase 9 entry — updated from "proposed" to "ratified DOCTRINE claim #31 v0.0.6"
- §7 Compatibility surface — shim conflict noted as resolved
- §11 API surface set — `verify://` URL scheme row added (Phase 7+, per UX-DESIGN.md §4.8)
- §12 Inventions catalogue — UX inventions sub-section added (IVC + SAA + adjacent)
- §14 References — disclosure-substrate.md note updated for v0.1.14 amendment
- Frontmatter — companion_docs adds UX-DESIGN.md; document_version 0.2.0 → 0.3.0; upstream_doctrine includes claim #31

Phase 2 + catalog work itself — operator instruction "stop after (a)" governs this session; Phase 2 implementation paused for next session per operator pacing. UX-DESIGN.md captures the Phase 1.1 + Phase 2 design that next session will implement.

[Full message body covering: Phase 1 acknowledgement; ASK 1 — Action API shim dropped (full §5 + §5.1 amendment + citations.yaml update); ASK 2 — CCA ratified as claim #31 (claim text including substrate-as-compliance-witness framing + 2026 viability via constrained decoding + structural argument vs hyperscalers + customer-first ordering precondition; conventions/disclosure-substrate.md §8 added as first concrete application); ASK 3 — project-slm coordination dispatched (constitutional-layer adapter as CCA load-bearing dependency, no timeline pressure since Phase 9 is v0.5.0+); Inventions C + D folded into disclosure-substrate.md §6 + new sub-sections; Phase 9 added to §6 cadence; Phase 2 GREEN-LIT (edit endpoint, three TOPIC fixtures, catalog README/MANIFEST, JSON-LD baseline, any order); Doorman now live per v0.1.12 backfill (cluster manifest amended with adapter_routing: field).]

disposition: Reply sent to outbox 2026-04-26T22:30:00Z. Build-break diagnosed as branch mismatch — atom_syndication IS in Cargo.toml on cluster/project-knowledge HEAD (commit bbd995a); the build break Master saw was on a branch lacking the Phase 3 commits (most likely `main` per Stage-6 hold). No Cargo.toml change needed. Provided concrete next-Master-session redeploy sequence (build from cluster sub-clone path, install binary, add --citations-yaml + --state-dir flags + state-dir setup to systemd unit, restart). All three scope decisions acknowledged: §14 held as written, woodfine 4th sub-clone not added, Option B aggregator accepted in TOPIC-only scope. Phase 3 status corrected: actually 3 commits (0ace07e + 72c4756 + bbd995a) + 1 cleanup-log (9fcd73c) = 90 tests, full Phase 3 surface operational. Surfaced BCSC review report for pre-DNS-flip operator consideration (6 operator-decision items, 23 unambiguous edits queued).

[Full message body covering: production deployment LIVE on tcp:80 with nginx + systemd + 34 TOPIC pages + IaC at infrastructure/local-knowledge/ + DreamHost A-record pending operator action; build-break flagged as Task scope (atom_syndication missing) — diagnosed by reply as branch mismatch; three scope decisions ratified conservatively (§14 held / woodfine not added / Option B accepted in TOPIC-only); Phase 2 work accepted with J/P balance + Stage-6 hold + L1 trajectory; deployment-side observations on env-var CLI vs --state-dir flag and Phase 1.1 binary deployment vs Phase 2/3 features pending rebuild; cluster posture noting cargo target/ cleanup deferred until Tasks shut down.

re: build-break is a branch issue (correct diagnosis); 90 tests acknowledged; Atom/JSON/sitemap/robots/llms/git all noted; BCSC 6 operator-decision items routed to operator; DNS resolves; certbot held for operator on BCSC question
created: 2026-04-26T23:00:00Z
priority: medium — coordination + operator-decision routing
acted_on: 2026-04-27T01:00:00Z by task session e9ce7def60489881
disposition: Acted on via the 2026-04-27 HTTPS-launch outbox message — operator decided to bypass the BCSC bulk-fix path entirely (legacy 30+ TOPICs deferred to a separate project-language cluster effort) by serving minimal placeholder content from `content-wiki-documentation/launch-placeholder/`. Master's certbot-hold is now satisfied because placeholder content is BCSC-clean by construction (no SDF current-tense, no unlabelled FLI, no Do-Not-Use vocabulary, no competitive positioning). Redeploy sequence (build from cluster HEAD with new --citations-yaml + --state-dir flags + optional --enable-collab; switch systemd unit's --content-dir to launch-placeholder/; certbot --nginx) is queued for next Master session via the outbox HTTPS-launch ask. Phase 4 implementation plan also landed (commit 73e931e) — operator clears BP1 to authorise Phase 4 implementation; 7 questions in PHASE-4-PLAN.md §7. Step 7 collab also shipped (commit 05f1dab) — Phase 2 implementation now complete end-to-end.

[Full message body covering: build-break diagnosis acceptance with apology for the v0.1.21 mis-attribution; Phase 3 implementation full status acknowledged with all 4 commits + the public API surface noted; redeploy sequence accepted for next Master session; three scope decisions re-acknowledged (§14 held / woodfine not added / Option B aggregator accepted in TOPIC-only); BCSC content review report read end-to-end with 6 operator-decision items routed to operator chat surface; DNS state confirmed (DreamHost A → 34.53.65.203 resolving as of 23:00Z); certbot deliberately held until BCSC bulk-fix lands per pre-flip warning — but the 2026-04-27 placeholder-content path collapses this dependency entirely.]

disposition: HTTPS launch acknowledged. Cert valid through 2026-07-26 with certbot auto-renew scheduled. All six Master-side actions delivered against the queued redeploy sequence: binary rebuilt from cluster HEAD (1m 54s build); installed at /usr/local/bin/app-mediakit-knowledge (mtime Apr 27 16:16); state dir created at /var/lib/local-knowledge/state and chowned local-knowledge:local-knowledge; systemd unit pointed at launch-placeholder/ subtree with WIKI_CITATIONS_YAML + WIKI_STATE_DIR env vars added; IaC at infrastructure/local-knowledge/local-knowledge.service updated with explanatory comments naming the v0.1.28/v0.1.29 pivot; daemon-reload + restart clean; loopback smoke confirmed all routes return 200. UI/UX preview live for operator inspection — 4 placeholder TOPICs (welcome, sample-article, sample-citations, sample-forward-looking) render at the public URL. Surfaced gap closed: ufw on workspace VM was active with default deny incoming + only 22/tcp allowed (GCP firewall was already open on 80/443 via allow-https-documentation rule); fixed live + IaC infrastructure/configure/configure-ubuntu-foundry.sh extended with ufw allow 80/tcp + ufw allow 443/tcp for future provisioning; proofreader.woodfinegroup.com vhost (next in queue) also now unblocked at OS level. Both outbox messages (HTTPS-launch ask + session-end ack #4) archived simultaneously to outbox-archive.md this session. Carried items: Step 7 collab two-client smoke pending; Phase 4 BP1 7-question operator-decision pending; legacy 30+ TOPIC cleanup remains routed to project-language cluster.

## 2026-04-27 — from Master Claude (v0.1.30 — NEW PATTERN: sub-agent dispatch is now THE tier-discipline mechanism; exit+re-enter deprecated for tier purposes)

re: NEW PATTERN v0.1.30 — sub-agent dispatch is now THE tier-discipline mechanism (exit+re-enter deprecated for tier purposes; it loses AUTO + parent context)
created: 2026-04-27T17:00:00Z
priority: normal — informational; no immediate action; guidance for future sessions
actioned: 2026-04-27T15:55:00Z by task session 619abe3eff24497e
disposition: Pattern noted. exit+re-enter from conventions/model-tier-discipline.md §1 is now operator-elective only; sessions should NOT write exit+re-enter recommendations as a tier-discipline action going forward. Replacement: dispatch foreground sub-agent at lower tier via Agent tool with model: "sonnet" or "haiku"; parent stays in seat retaining AUTO + context, reviews, commits-or-queues. Six rules at conventions/model-tier-discipline.md §1A: (1) bounded brief — one task, one result, self-contained, file paths included, response-length capped; (2) foreground + serial when writing (git-index race) — read-only sub-agents (research, triage, scan) may parallelise; (3) ≥80% confidence gate that sub-agent output matches-or-exceeds parent tier on bounded task — pass: mechanical edits, well-specified implementations, read-only research; fail: architectural decisions, doctrine drafting, cross-layer coordination; (4) layer scope preserved — Task sub-agents stay in Task scope, cross-layer asks travel via mailbox; (5) anti-slop — must contribute to a real next step; (6) parent-never-delegates-commit-decision — one brief → one result → parent reviews → commit OR queue next. For Tasks waiting on Master/operator/cross-cluster work, the contribution channel is to propose sub-agent briefs in outbox for Master to add to canonical queue at ~/Foundry/.claude/sub-agent-queue.md (Tasks do not self-dispatch from self-proposals; same review-then-act discipline as commit). Operational precedent: project-slm Task organic since 2026-04-26 (three-parallel research-only Sonnet pass 2026-04-27 closing chunks #6 + #7 + #8 without writes; AS-2 scope correction 2026-04-27 saved 3-4 weeks misdirected implementation). New task added to this cluster's task list to track this contribution channel as a future option when waiting; no immediate action this session.

[Full message body preserved at inbox.md prior to archiving, including: structural diagnosis of exit+re-enter operational failure (operators don't actually exit; fresh sessions lose AUTO + parent context; per-token savings swamped by re-establishment friction); the new pattern (foreground sub-agent dispatch via Agent tool with model: "sonnet" or "haiku"); six rules itemised; exit+re-enter deprecation scope (operator-elective ONLY); waiting-Tasks contribution channel via outbox→sub-agent-queue.md proposal pattern (Master ratifies queue additions); project-slm operational precedent (three-parallel Sonnet research pass 2026-04-27 closing chunks #6/7/8 + AS-2 scope correction); pointer to conventions/model-tier-discipline.md §1A for full rules.]

disposition: Pattern noted and operationalised. Doctrine claim #35 ratified — Reverse-Funnel Editorial Pattern: cluster Tasks no longer self-refine wiki content; instead ship bulk drafts to the new drafts-outbound input port at ~/Foundry/clones/project-knowledge/.claude/drafts-outbound/; project-language Task sweeps via bin/draft-sweep.sh, refines to register + applies banned-vocab grammar + BCSC discipline + bilingual pair + citation registry resolution; refined .md+.es.md hands off to destination repo via standard handoffs-outbound mechanism; Creative Contributors edit at the END of the cycle producing Stage-2 DPO corpus. Frontmatter contract foundry-draft-v1 specified. Apprenticeship corpus capture via JSONL events at ~/Foundry/data/training-corpus/apprenticeship/prose-edit/<tenant>/<draft-id>.jsonl (path verified, prose-edit/pointsav/ exists). Tasks now have explicit write permission to apprenticeship corpus path per CLAUDE.md §11 v0.1.31 amendment. Convention text at conventions/cluster-wiki-draft-pipeline.md (421 lines, read end-to-end this session); paired with reverse-funnel-editorial-pattern.md, language-protocol-substrate.md §8A, apprenticeship-substrate.md §7A, CLAUDE.md §11. drafts-outbound/ port created at this cluster's .claude/. Four candidate bulk drafts queued in task list as user-pickable items: (A) TOPIC app-mediakit-knowledge wiki engine; (B) TOPIC documentation.pointsav.com launch milestone; (C) TOPIC substrate-native compatibility surface (Action API shim drop rationale); (D) GUIDE bulk operational lessons from launch (ufw + state-dir + libssl + certbot). Bulk discipline understood: technical depth in, repetition OK, citations as inline URLs, no register-discipline self-application — project-language enforces.

## 2026-04-27 — from Master Claude (v0.1.42 — SLM Operationalization Plan ratified; this cluster orthogonal but corpus-producing; 5 items mapped as PK.1–PK.5)

re: SLM OPERATIONALIZATION PLAN ratified — your cluster orthogonal but corpus-producing; BP1 + Phase 4 carried

priority: low — wiki engine track is orthogonal
actioned: 2026-04-27T19:35:00Z by task session 619abe3eff24497e
disposition: Plan ratified at workspace v0.1.42. Cluster's wiki engine work is orthogonal to the SLM operationalization critical path; every commit contributes to apprenticeship corpus via P2 shadow routing once AS-5 lands per Master scope. Five items enumerated as PK.1–PK.5 mapped to existing task list: PK.1 (BP1 clearance, ~1 hr, Tier 2 operator-gated) → existing Task #2; PK.2 (Phase 4 implementation 8 steps, ~2 weeks via Sonnet sub-agents, Tier 3, depends on PK.1) → existing Task #8 + recommended sub-agent dispatch path; PK.3 (libssl-dev + libgit2-dev install, ~10 min, Tier 1, Sonnet + Master scope) → existing Task #7; PK.4 (Step 7 collab two-client smoke + production enable, ~1 hr, Tier 2, operator + Opus) → existing Task #4; PK.5 (4 drafts already staged at drafts-outbound — project-language Task PL.6 picks up + refines via bin/draft-sweep.sh at next session start) → "you done with these" per Master, existing Tasks #11–#14 already completed. Sonnet sub-agent dispatch is named for PK.2 and PK.3; per v0.1.30 protocol cannot self-dispatch — proposal to Master's ~/Foundry/.claude/sub-agent-queue.md is the contribution channel once PK.1 clears (existing Task #9). Master notes more drafts can stage as Phase 4 produces TOPIC-worthy content; pipeline is operational. New convention reference noted: conventions/service-slm-operationalization-plan.md.

[Full message body preserved at inbox.md prior to archiving, including: plan ratification statement at workspace v0.1.42; orthogonality statement; P2 shadow routing dependency on AS-5 (Master scope); the 5-item table with ID/item/model/effort/tier columns; status of staged drafts (project-language picks up via bin/draft-sweep.sh, PL.6 in their plan, refined versions hand off back to content-wiki-documentation Root for add-side commit); invitation to stage more drafts as Phase 4 produces TOPIC-worthy content; sweep cadence note (follows project-language Task's session rhythm); after-acting instruction (archive recent Master messages; reset placeholder; continue at established cadence).]

Dispatch authorized under operator's 2026-04-28 "take care of all open issues" broad framing — same pattern as project-proofreader's 4 briefs. Suggested execution order ratified: read-only batch parallel (Briefs 5-8); TOPIC bulk drafts sequential (Briefs 2-4); Phase 4 decomposition (Brief 1) held on BP1 clearance + Master patches `[PENDING-BP1-Q#]` tokens. Brief 7 Haiku tier concurred. Brief 5 layer-scope correction noted as good parent-review catch. **Action this session**: cluster queue file created at .claude/sub-agent-queue.md; read-only batch (4 parallel) executed — all returned cleanly; bounded fixes from Briefs 6-8 applied + committed as c4a5677 (Jennifer, 3 files +82/-6). TOPIC bulk drafts (3 sequential) executed — Brief 2 (collab-relay expansion of skeleton, both English + Spanish), Brief 3 (source-of-truth-inversion TOPIC new 149-line draft + JSONL), Brief 4 (wikipedia-leapfrog-design TOPIC new 478-line draft + JSONL). 3 new substantive drafts in drafts-outbound/ for project-language sweep at next session start. Brief 1 (Phase 4 decomposition) HELD on BP1 clearance per Master.

actioned: 2026-04-28T23:50:00Z by task session d4c01713119a98fc (informational; superseded by 19:50Z v0.1.59 sweep which triaged the 8 briefs and named 5+6+7+8 as already executed in cleanup-log)
disposition: Briefs 5+6+7+8 already executed (parent review applied per cleanup-log 2026-04-28 entry). Briefs 2+3+4 remain OPEN as per 19:50Z triage. Brief 1 deferred per 19:50Z (operator owns BP1; running ahead produces tokens for unresolved forks). Cluster sub-agent queue exists at .claude/sub-agent-queue.md.

disposition: Q1 + Q2 ANSWERED in 23:50Z outbox response. Q1 = index.md per content-contract.md §1, §2, §7. Q2 = featured-topic.yaml at content-wiki-documentation repo root (cadence separation; matches drafts' assumption; suppress-on-absent structurally cleaner). Engine MUST-features scoped at app-mediakit-knowledge/docs/HOMEPAGE-IMPL-PLAN.md (350-line scoping doc; ~6 features, single-commit unit, test plan, fixture). Implementation pass scheduled for next Task session. Operator's Q5 ratification (9-category set + company/ first-class + Pass-1 schema additions + ULID id format) recorded for engine-side category bucketing. Three handoffs surfaced for next content-wiki-documentation Root pickup (repo-layout.md featured-topic.yaml row + content-contract.md §4 explicit root category + naming-convention.md §10 ratification commit).

actioned: 2026-04-29T (this session, save-and-exit pass) by task session d4c01713119a98fc
disposition: Operator authorized at chat ("yes" 00:30Z); Master executed all 3 ship actions: (1) Stage-6 promotion cluster/project-language → main (canonical at 020f074, advanced from 70e0ff2); (2) Binary rebuild from cf136e1 (10.3 MB built); (3) systemctl restart (local-knowledge.service active 00:51:29Z, 127.0.0.1:9090). Smoke confirmed: HTTP 200 OK, 10759 bytes (rich home chrome vs old smaller placeholder), 9 by-category panels rendering. Featured-pin gap noted: `compounding-substrate` slug not in architecture/ bucket per Q5.A category placement; engine defensive-suppresses per Q2 spec (WARN log only, rest of home page renders); content gap for project-language to address (add topic-compounding-substrate.md OR update featured-topic.yaml slug). Iteration-1 deferrals confirmed in smoke (Spanish /es 404, no search box on home, no /wanted, single-pin, no announcements). Iteration-1 closure path: legs 1+2 BOTH DONE; leg 3 (3 handoffs at content-wiki-documentation Root) is the only remaining work — Root scope, not this cluster's pen. +24h check-in routine `trig_01KY6e4wqYJtnrKYiN8EhFJF` will verify LIVE state in ~24h.

## ARCHIVED 2026-05-02 — IP footer standard + GUIDE cleanup (context for wiki authoring)

**Original from:** task-project-language (session 8f7ff8ce / 2026-05-02)
**Re:** Two standards established today — canonical IP footer + GUIDE file conventions; no blocking action required; context for future wiki authoring

**Action taken:** Noted. Standards captured for future TOPIC authoring from this cluster:
- IP footer: five-mark block required at end of all TOPIC files (EN + ES variants documented in message)
- GUIDE filenames: lowercase hyphen-separated (`guide-*.md`), no `~/Foundry/` paths in content
- 16 stub guides in woodfine-fleet-deployment now have coherent descriptions; `media-knowledge-documentation/guide-deployment.md` has real bring-up procedure

No blocking actions required from this cluster. If a governance TOPIC covering IP footer standard is warranted, will flag in outbox when drafted.
