re: WFD spoke-configs/ removed — security cleanup; merge from canonical needed

Security action taken by Command Session. Three WireGuard private keys were in
woodfine-fleet-deployment/fleet-infrastructure-leased/spoke-configs/ on the
public GitHub repo. Canonical cleaned via commit 13f11cc (mcorp-administrator).

The spoke-configs/ working-tree directory was removed from your cluster clone
as a security measure. Git will show the .conf files as unstaged deletions.

Action at your next WFD session:
  cd woodfine-fleet-deployment
  git status
  git merge --ff-only origin/main   (or rebase if local commits ahead)

Two guide files rescued to fleet-infrastructure-leased/ directly:
  guide-macos-endpoints.md + guide-peter-macbook.md
