# Cluster manifest — project-proofreader

Multi-clone N=2 cluster (seventh cluster overall). Two sub-clones in
one cluster directory; one Task session writes to one `.git/index` at
a time per Doctrine §IV.c.

## Mission

Operational write-assistant for SMB-shaped editorial work, deployed at
**https://proofreader.pointsav.com** (Vendor-tier UI domain). Owns:

- `service-proofreader/` Rust crate (NEW project in pointsav-monorepo)
  — HTTP service: text in + protocol → improved text + diff out;
  consumes service-slm Doorman (Tier A/B/C) + service-content
  (retrieval-augmented context) + service-disclosure (CFG +
  templates) at request time.
- `app-console-proofreader/` Rust/Axum thin web app (NEW project in
  pointsav-monorepo) — Console-OS pattern UI: paste box + explicit
  protocol selector + side-by-side diff with flag-don't-rewrite
  default + "explain why" affordance + "regenerate via Tier B" button
  + Tier-C escape (allowlist).
- New Vendor-tier catalog folder
  `vendor/pointsav-fleet-deployment/gateway-orchestration-proofreader/`
  with deployment runbook (Task drafts; Master ships
  `infrastructure/local-proofreader/` workspace-tier artefacts when
  Task signals ready).

The user said:

> "Even if we are just testing the UI/UX and the copy is yet to come,

Day-1 priority: **ship a working web UI fast**, even with stubbed
content, so iteration happens against live deployment.

## Required reading (in order, before Phase 1)

1. **`~/Foundry/conventions/language-protocol-substrate.md`** — full
2. **DOCTRINE.md claims #15, #21, #22, #25, #31, #32, #33** —
   substrate-composing set
3. **`~/Foundry/conventions/apprenticeship-substrate.md`** — verdict-
   signed editorial training (your editorial actions ARE training events)
4. **`~/Foundry/conventions/zero-container-runtime.md`** — service
   ships as native systemd unit, not Docker (LanguageTool runs in
   Docker as a companion; service-proofreader is native Rust binary)
5. **Cluster manifest** at `.claude/manifest.md`
6. **Cross-cluster:** `clones/project-language/.claude/inbox.md` (read
   the parallel cluster's brief — your service-proofreader Cargo deps
   include service-disclosure when project-language ships Phase 1A)

## Branch + remotes

`cluster/project-proofreader` in each sub-clone (created 2026-04-27 from
local upstream `main`).

- pointsav-monorepo: `origin` admin alias + `origin-staging-j` +
  `origin-staging-p`
- woodfine-fleet-deployment: customer-tier admin alias `origin` only

## Trajectory capture

Enabled. L1 capture hook installed in both sub-clones at provisioning.

## Cross-cluster coordination

- **`project-language` Task** ships `service-disclosure/` Rust crate as
  Cargo dependency. Until they ship Phase 1A-1C, your service-
  proofreader operates with **hardcoded protocol-templates** stubbed
  in your own crate. Once they ship and surface schema-stable signal
  via outbox-to-Master, Master relays to you and you upgrade Cargo
  dependency to consume the published crate.
- **`project-slm` Task** owns service-slm Doorman + service-content.
  service-proofreader consumes both at request time. Doorman live at
  `127.0.0.1:9080` per workspace v0.1.13; routes Tier A → local OLMo
  3 7B at `127.0.0.1:8080` (live).
- **`project-knowledge` Task** owns app-mediakit-knowledge wiki engine.
  No direct cross-cluster dependency for project-proofreader; the
  proofreader is its own deployment instance.
